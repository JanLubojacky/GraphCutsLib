# GraphCutsLib
A python library for graph cuts based image segmentation written in rust as a semestral project for my medical imaging class at Czech Technical University Faculty o Electrical Engineering.

It uses Edmons-Karp so it is probably much too slow for any practical use. Maybe one day I will rewrite it to use something speedier like Boykov-Kolmogorov.
